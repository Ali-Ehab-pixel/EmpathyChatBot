# EmpathyChatBot
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that can detect emotions in text and respond empathetically using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

ðŸš€Key Features:
Emotion Detection: Uses a pre-trained Hugging Face model to classify user input into positive, neutral, or negative.
Response Retrieval (RAG) â†’ Searches a custom corpus (corpus.json) using FAISS embeddings for relevant response templates.
Natural Responses â†’ Combines retrieved responses with few-shot prompting for human-like answers.
Interactive Demo â†’ Deployable via Streamlit or Gradio, and easily shareable on Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud.

ðŸ”Ž As a User you type in your input, RAG retrieves the emotion of your input using a retrieve function, then generates a rresponse using a generate_response function. The Chatbot classifies 3 emotions, positive, negative, neutral. It also applies on JOY, SADDNESS.
